2 Java Challenge: String to ASCII ConverterIntroductionEvery character on a computer is secretly represented by a number. The most common system for this is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). In this assignment, you will build a program that converts a word or phrase into a single, continuous string of its corresponding ASCII numbers.This assignment is the first part of a two-part challenge. The format you create here will be used in a later assignment to convert the numbers back into the original text!Learning ObjectivesThis assignment will help you practice:Reading String input from a user.Using a for loop to iterate through the characters of a String.Accessing individual characters using the .charAt() method.Casting a char to an int to get its ASCII value.Using conditional logic (if statements) to pad numbers with leading zeros.Your TaskYour goal is to write the logic inside the StringToAscii.java file. The program should perform the following steps:Prompt the user to enter a word or phrase.Read the entire line of text into a String variable.Use a for loop to go through each character of the input String.Inside the loop, for each character:Get the character's integer ASCII value.Check if the value is less than 3 digits long. If it is, you must add the correct number of leading zeros to it (e.g., 72 becomes 072, 9 becomes 009).Print the 3-digit ASCII value without a new line. All the numbers should form one continuous string.Example InteractionIf the user runs your program and types Hi!, the output should be exactly:Enter a word or phrase to convert to an ASCII string:
Hi!
Your ASCII string is: 072105033
Notice how 'H' (72) becomes 072, 'i' (105) stays 105, and '!' (33) becomes 033.Getting StartedClone the repository. Open the StringToAscii.java file and fill in the logic where indicated by the // TODO comments.SubmissionCommit and push your completed code to GitHub.
